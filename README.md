### Android Release Gotchas
* `Could not find or load main class java.se.ee` (when using `./gradlew assembleRelease`)
  * Remove this line from your `.bash_profile`:

  * [GitHub thread](https://github.com/researchgate/gradle-release/issues/187)
* `Task 'installRelease' not found in root project`
  * Check for `signingConfig` in `buildTypes` > `release` (in `app/build.gradle`)

* `adb` can't find connected device (Mac OSX)
  * Solution: 
    1. Find device VendorID in System Preferences. 
    1. `echo [VENDOR_ID] >> ~/.android/adb_usb.ini`
    1. `adb kill-server ; adb devices`
  * [SO Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7135999/adb-not-finding-my-device-phone-macos-x#answer-7136003)
* `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`
  * Solution: 
    * On device, uninstall the app and try again. 
* Debugging release build crashes
  * `adb logcat AndroidRuntime:E *:S` will tail the logs of a connected device.
