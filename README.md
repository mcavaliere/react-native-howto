### Android Release Gotchas
* `Could not find or load main class java.se.ee` (when using `./gradlew assembleRelease`)
  * Remove this line from your `.bash_profile`: 
`export JAVA_OPTS='-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions --add-modules java.se.ee'`
  * [GitHub thread](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16093#issuecomment-390489264)

* `Could not get unknown property 'release' for SigningConfig container.`
  * Just put the `signingConfigs` block on top of `buildTypes` block in your `build.gradle`.
  * [GitHub thread](https://github.com/researchgate/gradle-release/issues/187)
* `Task 'installRelease' not found in root project`
  * Check for `signingConfig` in `buildTypes` > `release` (in `app/build.gradle`)
    * [GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/16854#issuecomment-348376236)
* `adb` can't find connected device (Mac OSX)
  * Solution: 
    1. Find device VendorID in System Preferences. 
    1. `echo [VENDOR_ID] >> ~/.android/adb_usb.ini`
    1. `adb kill-server ; adb devices`
  * [SO Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7135999/adb-not-finding-my-device-phone-macos-x#answer-7136003)
* `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`
  * Solution: 
    * On device, uninstall the app and try again. 
* Debugging release build crashes
  * `adb logcat AndroidRuntime:E *:S` will tail the logs of a connected device.
* `Too many classes in --main-dex-list, main dex capacity exceeded`
  * In `app/build.gradle` add the below, then run and run `./gradlew assembleProdRelease`: 
  ```
     android {
        dexOptions {
            keepRuntimeAnnotatedClasses false
        }

    }
    ```
  * [GitHub Comment](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/1166#issuecomment-372293580)
* Standalone (device) APK builds not updating: 
  * Make sure you got the right APK. Check the folder `./android/app/build/outputs/apk`.
* `JNI DETECTED ERROR IN APPLICATION: fid == null` When running standalone release build: 
  * Caused by Proguard issue
  * Quick fix: Comment out `minifyEnabled true` in `app/build.gradle`
  
* Failed to complete Gradle execution. Cause: Already disposed: Module: 'MYMODULENAME'
  * Delete `.idea/modules.xml` and `.idea/modules/` if it exists.

  * `react-native bundle --dev false --platform android --entry-file index.android.js --bundle-output ./android/app/build/intermediates/assets/debug/index.android.bundle --assets-dest ./android/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/debug`
    1. `cd android`
    2. Create debug build: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
    3. Create release build: `./gradlew assembleRelease`
    4. Generated `apk` will be located at `android/app/build/outputs/apk`

  * Check `http://192.168.your.ip:19000` in device browser
  * Check `http://localhost` in device browser
  * Set `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME` to `localhost` or ip (`REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=localhost yarn start`)
